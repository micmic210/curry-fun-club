    * I confirmed that the all sections on each three pages are readable.

    * I have confirmed that the form works fine: all fields need to be entered to submit the form. 

## Bugs 

    Sloved bugs 
        * I found that I sometimes added extra and less closing curry brackets for media quary for CSS and fixed the problems.

## Varidator Testing

    * HTML 
        * No errors were found when checking with the official W3C validator. 

    * CSS
        * No errors were found when checking with the official (Jigsaw)validator. 

    * Accessibility 
        * I confirmed accessbility through lighthouse in devtools. 


Unfixed Bugs
    * I was not able to fix bugs on unused codes in CSS. This is because I have created the website from PC view first and needed to add some media quaries that override the original code. I wanted to fix this issue, but I was running out the time. From next time, I will make sure to start with the smaller divices so that there would not be any redundant codes. 

    * Moreover, my HTML has too much ids and classes that have confused me in the end. I should carefuuly plan the overall structure to prevent my codes from being complicated. 

## Deployment 
    * The site was deployed to GitHub pages as following:
    * In the GitHub repository, go to the Setting tab
    * From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
    * Then, the page provided the link to the completed website.
