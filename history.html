                <p>Japanese curry, known as "kare", is a popular dish in Japan with a rich history that reflects the
                    nation's
                    interactions with other cultures. <br>Here is a brief overview of its history:</p>

            <dl id="history-box" class="flex">
                <dt class="description">Early Introduction</dt>
                <dd>19th Century: Curry was introduced to Japan during the Meiji era (1868-1912) by the British, who had
                    adapted
                    Indian curry to suit their tastes during their colonial rule in India. The British brought curry
                    powder and
                    recipes to Japan, where it was first served in the Japanese Navy to prevent beriberi, a disease
                    caused by a
                    vitamin B1 deficiency.</dd>
                <dt class="description">Adaptation and Popularization</dt>
                <dd>Late 19th to Early 20th Century: Curry began to spread beyond the military and was adapted to
                    Japanese
                    tastes,
                    resulting in a milder and thicker version compared to Indian curry. This adaptation often included
                    ingredients
                    like potatoes, carrots, and onions, along with meat, typically pork, beef, or chicken.
                </dd>
                <dt class="description">Post-War Expansion</dt>
                <dd>Post-World War II: Curry became increasingly popular as it was inexpensive and easy to prepare. The
                    introduction of ready-made curry roux in block form in the 1950s by companies like S&B Foods
                    significantly
                    contributed to its widespread popular. The roux made it convenient for Japanese households to
                    prepare curry at
                    home.</dd>
                <dt class="description">Cultural Integration</dt>
                <dd>Mid to Late 20th Century: Japanese curry became a staple of Japanese cuisine, often served with rice
                    (kareraisu), udon noodles (kare udon), or even as a filling for bread (kare pan). School cafeterias
                    began
                    serving it regularly, and it became a comfort food for many Japanese people.</dd>
                <dt class="description">Contemporary Variations</dt>
                <dd>21st Century: Today, Japanese curry is enjoyed in various forms, including regional specialties like
                    Kanazawa
                    curry, which is known for its rich, thick sauce and is often served with tonkatsu. There
                    are also many curry restaurants and chains, such as Coco Ichibanya, which offers a wide range of
                    curry dishes
                    with
                    customizable spice levels and toppings.
                </dd>
                <dt class="description">Global Influence</dt>
                <dd>Japanese curry has also gained popularity outside of Japan, particularly in countries with
                    significant
                    Japanese expatriate communities. It has influenced and been influenced by various culinary
                    traditions around
                    the
                    world, contributing to the global appreciation of this unique dish.</dd>
